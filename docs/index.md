JelixDAO is an Object Relational Mapping system. It is to provide an easy
way to create, records and factories, using the DAO pattern.

A record object represents a database record: its properties are mapped on the
fields of one or more tables.

A factory object provides some methods allowing to create a record, to save it,
to destroy it or to retrieve some sets of record objects.

A record and factory object couple is described in an XML file. JelixDAO then handles
the generation of the corresponding PHP objects.

The XML file allows to avoid the tiresome writing of SQL requests, and to take care of
SQL injections problems: the generated objects handle everything. The XML file
can be generated by a development tool, like for example one of the scripts
featured with the Jelix framework.

JelixDao is a library born into the Jelix framework as the "JelixDao" component. It was extracted
from the project and is now a standalone project.
